Walking back to my hotel in Amsterdam at 2am, I come across a large number of
people searching the ground with their phones.
I couldn't help but notice that they were also underneath one of the
not-very-frequent lampposts on the street and wondered if it was because of
that old joke about better light.

They were asking any passers-by to help search for a diamond heart that had
accidentally been ripped from a necklace.
I joined the search, but after thirty minutes it was not looking hopeful
so I ran to my hotel to grab a bright flashlight.
Coming back, I was puzzled to find them a bit down the street from where I had
left them.
"What happened? Why are you looking over here," I asked.
Strangely, they didn't quite realize that they had moved, so I asked them to
replay the start of the evening for me so that we could look in the right spot.
The group had been walking home from a bar, when the brother playfully
attacked his sister and accidentally yanked the necklace, breaking it.
No one was sure if the jewel had flown far away or just dropped into clothing
or on the street; they also weren't sure any longer what part of the street
they were on when things went down.
Most confusing of all, the sister kept describing the jewel as a "diamond heart...
a red, diamond heart."
*Diamonds are not red.* [^1]

Being all suspicious of a scam, I quizzed them a bit more but they seemed
to just be drunk people who ran into some bad luck.
We reenacted the scene a little bit and tried to imagine where the heart
could have flown to.
And then using the brighter light, did some scans around the area where
they were searching, sifting through glass and leaves.
Still nothing.

My new friends were all concentrated "down the street" from where I first
met them.
I felt like we had searched the area pretty well, and then I had a hunch:
what if they had gotten confused over time, and where I first saw them
was closer to where the heart had been lost?
I moved back up the street, but was using my phone light again and could
not see much of anything.

A technique I have previously used was to lay on the ground to get a worm's eye
view of vertical displacement.
That is, I put my eye to the ground and look for any bumps in the road.
I guess seems pretty strange if you
haven't done it; in fact, a new passerby sat on me and played with my hair
while her boyfriend took a picture us[^2] ... and then they walked away without
talking to us!
I was trying to decide how I felt about that when a glint of red in the street
caught my eye and turned into the fabled diamond heart we had been looking for!

Everyone jumped on me to hug me. I was still laying on the ground, so I imagine
that it looked like one of those piles of people in a football game.
It felt like when I was a kid and we would play the dogpile game.

And we all lived happily ever after.

## Footnotes

[^1]: Actually, it is possible to have a red diamond, but it is extremely rare
      because they are difficult to make.

[^2]: Since they came from behind me while I was laying on the ground, I didn't see them coming or have any idea who it was; I initially thought it was one of the people I had been searching with.  I thought it was strange that they took a picture without asking or even talking to us, but I guess at 4am you should throw all your normal expectations out the window!
