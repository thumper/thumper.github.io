After being with my employer for five years, I got the awesome opportunity to
take a 30-day "recharge" from my responsibilities.
I eagerly read posts by others who had gone on recharge, looking for ideas on
what I could do to fill my time.
Some typical things people did were:

 * go home to spendtime with their family,
 * a "staycation" to catch up on chores and friends,
 * exercising and eating better (focus on health),
 * some light traveling to visit friends.

My first thoughts were some combination of these ideas, including going
camping and hiking, and maybe taking up some meditation.
I love being at home and in a normal routine, so a staycation that included
a good dose of the outdoors sounds very appealing... except that I have been
binge watching Netflix and could easily picture that I might fall into the
trap of never leaving the house.

To outsmart my tendency to be lazy, I decided to set a more ambitious goal:
travel around Europe for a month!
Aside from what my itinerary should be, the biggest worry I had was how to pack
for such a long trip.

## Light Packing Research

After searching for ideas on what to pack, I started stumbling across some great
blog posts by other travelers.
Here are some of the notable posts I found that helped me in my own packing:

* [One Bag](http://www.onebag.com/checklist.html) - this was the most thorough
  site I found on light travel. The checklists cover pretty much everything, so
  I used this as a master list and pruned back things that I didn't need.
  I should mention that this site favors "bundle packing", but the one time
  I tried it myself it happened to be at a place with bed bugs and disaster
  ensued.

* [Best Backpacking Hammocks](http://www.cleverhiker.com/best-backpacking-hammocks/)

I spent a long time reading through all these and much more to get some idea of
what patterns people followed for ultralight travel.
Most folks preferred using merino wool based shirts because they don't need so
much washing, and would use eBags to organize their stuff.
