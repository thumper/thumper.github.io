It is near the end of "intern season", and one intern asked me what advice I
would have given my younger self.
Flippantly, my answer was "none" because I wasn't good at taking advice --
I always followed my heart back then.


* be an apprentice, not an intern
* learn about expectations for each level
* Understand the team/org/company goals
* Don't let people waste your time


pay attention to WHAT they complain about, not WHO
what do they value
the best way to learn is by constant contact
surround yourself with the best, so you can become one of them
come up with choices, and WRITE DOWN pros and cons of all ideas.  This will guide you towards what you actually value.
learn to MILESTONE projects
at each point, you should have either learned something or it's a good place to stop the project
read "The One Thing"
Get stuff done, don't just talk about it

relationships are important
communication is important <-- don't assume people trust you!
listen to entrepreneurial podcasts
real estate ones, like Bigger Pockets, are very inspiring and talk about having the right mindset
Jordan Harbinger is great for people skills
Tim Ferriss is great for being open minded and exploring deeply
* ruthless prioritiezation
