When I travel, I only have a vague idea of what I want to see or sometimes no
idea at all.
What I have always done is shown up at an airport or train station and asked
for advice from the information desk about how to get to my lodging and some
things to see in town.
Usually the suggestions are to see the things that the town is most famous for
and which I already knew from googling about the town, but what I would really
like is some insider knowledge about where locals like to go and what they
like to do for fun.
I am starting to develop a system for getting around, and here are my notes
on how to do it.

## Lodging

I used to travel without booking any lodging at all.
This has led to some interesting adventures as I wander around a city looking
for a place, but it is also pretty stressful if (as happened in Vienna) the
only places I can find are far from the city center and I wasn't prepared
to use public transportation.
This worked out okay in Vienna because I did't mind walking a couple of miles
and I got to see a lot of shops and people along the way, but being closer to
the center would have given me more time to see museums and other sites.

To plan out my lodging, I check a few different apps/sites.

[booking.com](TODO) - seems to have the most comprehensive listing of
properties across the globe.
By examining the clustering of properties and their prices,

* [AirBnB](TODO) - 
* [Hostel World](TODO)
* [Couch Surfing]
